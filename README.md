### Hola 

In 2023, I came into contact with OpenSource through [OSPP](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/) and [GLCC](https://www.gitlink.org.cn/glcc), hoping to continue to make my own contributions to the OpenSource community.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [CAS](https://www.cas.cn/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸ¦€ Rust and â˜• Java
- ðŸ¤— Keep Coding!
