### Hola 

In 2023, I began to get involved in the open-source communities through participating in [OSPP](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/) and [GLCC](https://www.gitlink.org.cn/glcc), and in this process, I realized the great significance of contributing to open-source projects. So I hope to continue making contributions to open-source communities from this year onwards.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [CAS](https://www.cas.cn/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸ¦€ Rust and â˜• Java
- ðŸ¤— Keep Coding!
